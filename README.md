# ethernetcnc

This is my project for controlling CNC machine via ethernet port using LinuxCNC. It was originally shortly instroduced at http://pekka.eu/cnc. After receiving questions about it every now and then, I decided to publish it.

There is very little to no documentation about the project right now - hopefully that will change some day. There is the firmware for STM32F407, the kicad PCB and a LinuxCNC driver available.
